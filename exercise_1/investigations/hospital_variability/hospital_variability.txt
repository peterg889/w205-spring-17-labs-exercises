Approach:
First, I concatenated the effective care and readmissions data, normalizing the scheams, 
and removing any rows with missing data. I also dropped any rows with non-numeric data
Then I calculated the mean and standard deviation for each individual measure across 
the population. From there, I was able to calculate the z-score of each hospital test 
results. Z-scores are a measure of standardized variability, so I was able to use them 
to assess where variability was the greatest across scores with different scales
and unknown true mins and maxes. High variability measures could have either very high
or very-low z-scores, so I took the absolute value of the z-score, then looked for the highest.

The data above are the metric name along with the highest z-score
