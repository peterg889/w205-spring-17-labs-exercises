Conclusion:
The correlation between hospitals quality of care and patients is -0.162779981734. 
Therefore they are not correlated

Approach
First, I concatenated the effective care and readmissions data, normalizing the scheams, 
and removing any rows with missing data. I also dropped any rows with non-numeric data
Then I calculated the mean and standard deviation for each individual measure across 
the population. From there, I was able to calculate the z-score of each hospital test 
results. To determine the overall quality of care, I averaged the z-scores of each 
hospital. Note that this methodology introduces a non-linearity as a result of using 
the standard deviation (a z-score of 2 is harder to come by than a z-score of 1 and a 
z-score of 0), and assumes a normal distribution. 

To determine the overall survey result, I added HCAHPS Base Score and HCAHPS Consistency 
Score, based on information found in 
https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/hospital-value-based-purchasing/downloads/HospVBP_ODF_072711.pdf

I then created data frame of (hospital QOC, total score) and calculated the correlation,
resulting in the number above.

NB -- the methodology proposed by CMS takes the higher of a consistency score and an 
improvement score for when determining the overall score, which may mask some effects.
