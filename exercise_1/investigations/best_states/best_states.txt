Approach:
First, I concatenated the effective care and readmissions data, normalizing the scheams, 
and removing any rows with missing data. I also dropped any rows with non-numeric data
Then I calculated the mean and standard deviation for each individual measure across 
the population. From there, I was able to calculate the z-score of each hospital test 
results. To determine the overall quality of care by state, I grouped the test results
by state, then averaged the z-scores. Note that this methodology introduces a 
non-linearity as a result of using  the standard deviation (a z-score of 2 is harder to 
come by than a z-score of 1 and a  z-score of 0), and assumes a normal distribution. 

The data above are the state name and the averaged z-score

Using the averaged z-score by state helps to account for large differences in the 
scales of the data, and also not knowing the true min and maxes of the various measures.
A z-score is standardized by the standard deviation. The effect of the non-linearity
may be viewed as a positive depending on what "best" means. In this case, the 
non-linearity suppresses the effect of outliers in either direction, helping to 
point towards a consistent, holistic picture.
